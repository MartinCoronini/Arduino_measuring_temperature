# Arduino: Measuring atmospheric pollution

## Getting started

### Hardware

This project can be used with any Arduino motherboard, using a LCD screen for display and any temperature sensor. For this project, I used the [TMP36](https://www.arduino.cc/en/uploads/Main/TemperatureSensor.pdf) sensor.

### Software

This is a simple project used on an Arduino motherboard, using a LCD display and a temperature sensor.
The sensor's voltage varies depending on the temperature and the program will convert the voltage into a temperature value, which will be displayed on the LCD display. Values are updated every second on the screen.

## Run

Simply upload the code onto your Arduino and run the project.
